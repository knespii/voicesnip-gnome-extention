"""
Evdev-based global key listener (Wayland)

pynput's global keyboard listener relies on X11 and cannot capture keys under
Wayland. This module reads /dev/input/event* directly via python-evdev and
translates each event into the same pynput key objects pynput would emit, so it
is a drop-in replacement for ``pynput.keyboard.Listener``: same
``on_press``/``on_release`` callbacks, same ``start()``/``stop()``.

Because it emits pynput key objects, the existing HotkeyManager and
``format_hotkey`` logic work unchanged on both X11 and Wayland.

Requires read access to /dev/input/event* (membership in the 'input' group).

    Reading /dev/input/event* requires the process to *effectively* belong to

    to the group (so it shows up in the group database), but the current login
    session predates that change and therefore still lacks it -- the database
    and the live session credentials disagree. We distinguish those so we can
    tell the user to re-login instead of pointing them at the installer again.
